# Audiobookshelf MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides tools to interact with your [Audiobookshelf](https://www.audiobookshelf.org/) instance. Access your libraries, audiobooks, podcasts, authors, collections, and playlists through AI assistants that support MCP.

## Disclaimer

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK:** This software is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The author is not responsible for any misuse, accidents, data loss, or any other issues that may arise from using this software. Users are solely responsible for ensuring proper configuration and usage of this tool with their Audiobookshelf instance.

## Features

- List and retrieve libraries with optional sub-resources (items, authors, series, search, stats, …)
- Get individual items (audiobooks or podcasts), including cover images as MCP image content
- Browse authors (with author images), series, tags, and genres
- Create and manage collections and playlists
- Browse podcasts, fetch RSS feed metadata, parse OPML, and check for new episodes
- Read and update listening progress
- Inspect users, playback sessions, server status, backups, and filesystem paths
- Run over stdio or the MCP streamable HTTP transport (Docker image included)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- An Audiobookshelf instance with API access
- An API token from your Audiobookshelf instance

### Build from Source

Build from source or use Docker Compose below to install the server today.

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.25.2 or later

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schmidt-software/audiobookshelf-mcp.git
cd audiobookshelf-mcp
go build -o abs-mcp .
```

### Docker Compose

The server can run as a container exposing the MCP streamable HTTP transport (`http://localhost:8080/mcp`).

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # set ABS_BASE_URL and ABS_API_KEY
docker compose up -d --build
```

`MCP_PORT` sets the published host port in compose.

Example client configuration:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "audiobookshelf": { "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp" } } }
```

> **Security:** The HTTP endpoint has no authentication of its own. Anyone who can reach it can call every tool with the permissions of the configured `ABS_API_KEY`. Do not expose the port to untrusted networks; bind it to localhost (for example `127.0.0.1:8080:8080` in `docker-compose.yml`) or put it behind an authenticating reverse proxy.

### Pre-built Releases (once published)

This repository does not currently publish release downloads. Once releases are available, download the appropriate archive for your platform from the [latest release](https://github.com/schmidt-software/audiobookshelf-mcp/releases/latest). Archive names may vary by release.

**Installation steps for future release archives:**

1. Download the appropriate archive for your platform from the releases page
2. Extract the archive, replacing the filename with the archive you downloaded:
   ```bash
   tar -xzf <archive-name>.tar.gz
   ```
3. Move the binary to a location in your PATH (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # macOS/Linux
   sudo mv abs-mcp /usr/local/bin/

   # Or to a user directory
   mv abs-mcp ~/.local/bin/
   ```
4. Make it executable (macOS/Linux):
   ```bash
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/abs-mcp
   ```

## Configuration

The MCP server requires two pieces of configuration:

1. **ABS_BASE_URL** - The server URL of your Audiobookshelf instance, without `/api` (e.g., `https://abs.example.com`, or `https://abs.example.com/abs` when served under a reverse-proxy base path)
2. **ABS_API_KEY** - Your Audiobookshelf API token

### Getting Your API Token

**Audiobookshelf v2.26.0 and later (recommended):**

1. Log into your Audiobookshelf instance as an admin
2. Go to Settings → API Keys
3. Create a new API key, assign it to a user, and copy the key (it is only shown once)

**Older Audiobookshelf versions:**

1. Log into your Audiobookshelf instance
2. Go to Settings → Users → Your User
3. Copy the API token shown for the user

The MCP server can only do what the user behind the key is allowed to do. Some tools (for example `users`, `backups`, `create_backup`, `create_library`, and `filesystem`) require an admin user.

## Usage

### Environment Variables

You can set the configuration using environment variables:

```bash
export ABS_BASE_URL="https://abs.example.com"  # no /api suffix
export ABS_API_KEY="your-api-token-here"
```

Alternatively, you can pass these as parameters when calling tools (see Tool Parameters below).

Transport settings (optional): `MCP_TRANSPORT` (`stdio` by default, `http` for the streamable HTTP transport), `MCP_ADDR` (listen address for `http`, default `:8080`), and `MCP_ENDPOINT` (endpoint path for `http`, default `/mcp`).

### Setting Up with Witsy

[Witsy](https://github.com/nbonamy/witsy) is a desktop AI assistant that supports MCP servers. Here's how to set it up:

1. Open Witsy and go to Settings (⚙️ icon)
2. Navigate to the MCP section
3. Add a new server with the following configuration:

![Witsy MCP Configuration](_res/witsy.png)

**Configuration details:**
- **Type**: `stdio`
- **Label**: `abs-mcp` (or any name you prefer)
- **Command**: `/path/to/abs-mcp` (use the "Pick" button to select your compiled binary)
- **Arguments**: (leave empty)
- **Working Directory**: Any directory (e.g., `/Users/yourname/Downloads`)
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `ABS_BASE_URL` = `https://example.library.abs` (your Audiobookshelf URL, without `/api`)
  - `ABS_API_KEY` = `IM_A_LONG_STRING` (your API token)

4. Click "Save" to add the server
5. The server will now be available in your Witsy conversations!

### Setting Up with Claude Desktop

Add this to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "audiobookshelf": {
      "command": "/path/to/abs-mcp",
      "env": {
        "ABS_BASE_URL": "https://abs.example.com",

## Tool Parameters

All tools accept optional `base_url` and `token` parameters that override the environment variables. Use the Audiobookshelf server URL without `/api`; a reverse-proxy base path such as `/abs` is supported:

```json
{
  "base_url": "https://abs.example.com",
  "token": "your-api-token-here"
}
```

This is useful if you need to access multiple Audiobookshelf instances or prefer not to use environment variables.

## Example Queries

Once configured, you can ask your AI assistant questions like:

**Reading and browsing:**
- "Show me all my audiobook libraries"
- "What items are in my Fiction library?"
- "Get details about the author with ID abc123"
- "List all my playlists"
- "What's in my Currently Reading collection?"

**Creating and managing:**
- "Create a new collection called 'Summer Reads' in my library"
- "Add this book to my 'Currently Reading' collection"
- "Create a new playlist for my favorite sci-fi audiobooks"
- "Check for new podcast episodes"
- "Update my progress to 45 minutes on this audiobook"
- "Create a backup of my server"

The AI assistant will use the appropriate MCP tools to fetch information and manage your Audiobookshelf instance.

## Development

### Project Structure

- `main.go` - Server implementation: Audiobookshelf HTTP helpers (`absGET`, `absPOST`, `absPATCH`, …), handler factories, tool definitions in `newMCPServer()`, and transport selection in `main()`
- `*_test.go` - Tests against mock Audiobookshelf servers (`httptest`), including tests that call tools through the registered MCP server
- `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example` - Container image and Compose setup for the HTTP transport
- `.github/workflows/main.yaml` - CI: runs tests and builds on pushes to `main` and on pull requests; publishes releases via GoReleaser on `v*` tags

### Running Tests

```bash
go vet ./...
go test ./...
```

### Adding New Tools

To add a new tool:

1. Define the tool options in `newMCPServer()` using `mcp.NewTool()`
2. Add authentication parameters with `withABSAuth()`
3. Register the tool with `s.AddTool()`
4. Use helper functions like `createSimpleGETHandler()`, `createGETByIDHandler()`, `createGETByIDWithSubResourceHandler()`, or `createSimplePOSTHandler()`
5. Add tests that call the registered tool (see `callRegisteredTool()` and `newRecordingServer()` in `main_test.go`) and document the tool in this README
